# Database - Scalability

## Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling is the process of adding more machines to your pool of resources. This is done by adding more servers to your database cluster. This is the most common way to scale a database.

## Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling is the process of adding more resources to a single machine. This is done by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to a single server. This is less common than horizontal scaling.

## Sharding
Sharding is the process of splitting your data into smaller chunks and distributing them across multiple servers. This is done to improve performance and scalability. Sharding can be done in two ways:

    1. **Hash-based sharding**: Data is distributed across servers based on a hash of the data.
    2. **Range-based sharding**: Data is distributed across servers based on a range of values.
