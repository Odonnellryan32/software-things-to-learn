## Principles

- **Toil**: Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: SLOs are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to define the level of service a service provider agrees to provide and the level of service a user can expect. SLOs are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to define the level of service a service provider agrees to provide and the level of service a user can expect.
- **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**: SLIs are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to measure the performance and reliability of a service. SLIs are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to measure the performance and reliability of a service.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: SLAs are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to define the level of service a service provider agrees to provide and the level of service a user can expect. SLAs are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to define the level of service a service provider agrees to provide and the level of service a user can expect.
- **Error Budgets**: Error budgets are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to balance the need to innovate and release new features with the need to maintain a reliable service. Error budgets are a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. They are a way to balance the need to innovate and release new features with the need to maintain a reliable service.
- **Error Budget Policy**: Error budget policy is a key part of the site reliability engineering discipline. It is a way to define how error budgets are managed and how they are used to balance the need to innovate and release new features with the need to maintain a reliable service.
